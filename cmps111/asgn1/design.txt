My program is a shell that recreates various redirection and piping that standards shells use.

My program calls execvc() to execute commands, while specially handling the exit and cd internal commands. The program also handles redirection and piping by recognizing special characters and using the lex.l.

I used the execvc(), chdir(), close, dup2(), and pipe() functions. My main function handles the command parsing, while each individual function handles specific tasks, such as redirecting input, or piping.
