will not be graded and there is no credit for it.&nbsp;
However, it is important you understand the Unix command
line and submit procedure before you actually use it in the
first assignment.&nbsp;
<P>
Make sure you know how to submit files.&nbsp;
Submit these files to lab0.&nbsp;
Verify that the submit actually worked by looking
in the submit directory for your username.&nbsp;
The find(1) command is very useful for things like this.&nbsp;
<P>
The submit command copies your files into a directory
<BR>
<TT><U>/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/class/cmps112-wm.f16/lab0/$USER</U></TT>

and prefixes each file with a sequence number.&nbsp;
You can see the names of the files, 
but not their contents.&nbsp;
<P>
Prior experience with Unix is assumed.&nbsp;
Attend a lab section to ask questions if you don't
understand how submit works.&nbsp;
The TA can explain such things.&nbsp;
<P>
Also read the submit checklist:&nbsp;
