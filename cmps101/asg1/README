My program, graph01, takes in an input file that has its first line containing the amount
of allocated space given for the array, and the rest of the lines containing the numbers 
to go in the lists in the array.  You run the program by typing "graph01" followed by a 
space and the name of the file, or a "-" to recieve input from stdin. To print the 
output of stdin, press ctrl-D.

I have 3 test files. "test0.in" just tests to see if the nulls and entries are put into the
list. "test1.in" tests to see if multiple entries are put into each spot in the array.
"test2.in" tests how the program handles zeroes.
