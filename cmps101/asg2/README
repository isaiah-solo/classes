My program, graph02, takes in an input file that has its first line containing the amount
of allocated space given for the array, and the rest of the lines containing the numbers 
to go in the lists in the array.  You run the program by typing "graph02" followed by a 
space and the name of the file, or a "-" to recieve input from stdin. To print the 
output of stdin, press ctrl-D.

First, graph02 displays the original graph including a check to see if it has any cycles.
Then, it finds the transpose of the graph and checks for a cycle in that graph. Then, it
repeats until it transposes the graph 3 times.

I have 3 test files. "test0.in" just tests to see if the program works. "test1.in" tests
to see if a single vertex cycle is possible. "test2.in" tests how the program handles a 
graph with no cycles.

The header is updated with the transpose function and the cycle functions.
