My program, scc03, takes in an input file that has its first line containing the amount
of allocated space given for the array, and the rest of the lines containing the numbers 
to go in the lists in the array.  You run the program by typing "scc03" followed by a 
space and the name of the file, or a "-" to recieve input from stdin. To print the 
output of stdin, press ctrl-D.

My program is used to take an adjacency list and use dfs trace to traverse through the
list and find the discovery and finish times, the stack, and the parents. Then using the
transpose of the list, you find the discovery and finish times, the parents, and finally
the dfst roots, which are used to find the SCC's.


intList.c:

This file contains the functions listed in intList.c. Some of the functions listed are: 
intFirst, which returns the first int in the list; intRest, which returns the rest of the
list not including the first, which is free'd; and intCons, which basically adds a new 
element to the IntList.

intList.h:

This file contains the prototypes for the functions in intList.c. It also contains the 
pre and post conditions.

scc03.c:

This file calls all the functions from the header files and uses them to do the purpose 
of the assignment. It mainly holds aesthetic purposes in the main. It also contains the
functions transposeGraph, which creates the transpose of the given graph, and hasCycle 
and hasCycleLen, which work together to find a cycle within the graph.

Makefile:

This file is what is used to compile all the *.h and *.c files together to make an
executable.

test0.in:

This test file is basically used to test the program's functionality to see if it is
working properly.

test1.in:

This test file is used to see what happens if given a graph with 1 element.

test2.in:

This test file is used to see what happens if given a graph with a lot of tree edges.
