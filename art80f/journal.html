		<p class="entry-title">Prompt #1: Reproduction and Representation: Arrays, Grids, Avatars</p>

		<p>	If you imagine a virtual world, a world apart from our own yet<br/>
			much alike, what would be the possibilities in such world?  In<br/>
			the "real" world, this virtual world does exist in places such<br/>
			as video games and social media in which the user portrays<br/>
			himself/herself as someone different than themselves or someone<br/>
			they want to be.  This image based off of the Sims game series<br/>
			portrays the power of how avatars, the version of ourselves in<br/>
			the virtual world, can play on the human mind.<br/>
			<br/>
			In a virtual world, one can portray themselves as someone<br/>
			totally different from who they really are.  The image has four<br/>
			avatars and underneath are their "true" identities.  Looking at<br/>
			the avatars, you see that they appear as normal people:<br/>
			possessing humanlike features such as skin color, hair, face,<br/>
			etc.  However, behind every avatar there is a real person, and<br/>
			its not always the case where the real person actually resembles<br/>
			their avatar.  Because of the way their avatar appears, you are<br/>
			misguided into believing certain features about the real person<br/>
			are true.  "Putting a face on things also attaches the societal<br/>
			associations that such a face bears... An obvious example is<br/>
			that you do not need to be a female to appear in a female<br/>
			avatar" (Coleman 74).  With this power being both bolstering and<br/>
			decepting, someone can abuse it and possibly maliciously affect<br/>
			someone else in the process.  However, with the right<br/>
			intentions, one can use it as a way to enjoy and have fun with<br/>
			their endeavors.</p>

		<p class="entry-title">Prompt #2: Text as Representation / Text as Image</p>
		<p class="date">Posted: April 23rd, 2015</p>
		<img class="displayed" src="images/asg2.jpg" width="691" height="591"/><br/><br/><br/>
		<p>	In the modern day, it is becoming more acceptable for gay teens<br/>
			to come out.  However, around 20 years ago that was not the case.<br/>
			Many barriers caused these teens to feel isolated and alone, such<br/>
			as living in small towns and not being able to communicate with<br/>
			other gay teens.  It wasn't until the internet chatrooms were<br/>
			created and gay teens were able to find others that shared the<br/>
			same experiences and were able to find solace.  This image<br/>
			represents the power that the internet and chatrooms have and how<br/>
			they bring people together.<br/><br/>
			The image appears as an instant messenger box that contains words<br/>
			what look like a message being sent to another individual.  What<br/>
			the text says is a bunch of words that all seem to have different<br/>
			meanings and say different messages.  The way they are organized,<br/>
			however, is the journey of a teen going through an experience of<br/>
			not being accepted from the top to the bottom.  The top has words<br/>
			that a person feeling alone might feel, and towards the middle<br/>
			has words that relate to the internet and discovery, which is the<br/>
			internet and contact with other people that feel similar to the<br/>
			top or even people that have found solace. One person discovering<br/>
			what the internet can bring said, "'I still remember the first<br/>
			time I saw those Internet chat rooms on AOL,' she says. 'I was<br/>
			like, this is really different! And then suddenly we were able to<br/>
			get on the Web and find websites dedicated to the culture.'"<br/>
			(Henn 1). Towards the bottom, the words become more positive and<br/>
			describe feelings of comfort when people can gather as a<br/>
			community and share their experiences with others going through<br/>
			the same thing.  The icon in the corner is a closet signifying<br/>
			that the chat has helped people come out of the closet.</p>

		<p class="entry-title">Prompt #3: Interactivity and the Multi-Vocal Work</p>
		<p class="date">Posted: May 13th, 2015</p></br>

	 	<p>	Social media has become one of the most popular forms of<br/>
			communication, and it has become a daily use on the internet. It<br/>
			is a place where one is able to find other people that they can<br/>
			connect with. The thing is, race has become a very important<br/>
			issue when it comes to social media. The article "Roots and<br/>
			Revelation: Genetic Ancestry Testing and the YouTube Generation,"<br/>
			by Alondra Nelson and Jeong Won Hwang, mention the parallel<br/>
			developments of social networking technologies or SNS such as<br/>
			Twitter, Facebook, and especially YouTube, and the direct-to<br/>
			consumer genetic ancestry testing. They propose how both of these<br/>
			digital technologies create an understanding of race.<br/><br/>
			YouTube, among all of these SNSs have become very unique due to<br/>
			the fact that it is able to circulate and upload videos. Not only<br/>
			that, but different types of broadcasts on YouTube have been<br/>
			described as roots revelations. "Developments in computer science<br/>
			and molecular biology offer new avenues for the construction and<br/>
			performance of racial identity. Roots revelations videos suggest<br/>
			that African American genealogists' identities can be drawn not<br/>
			only from genetic ancestry results, but also from the networked<br/>
			interaction that occurs between broadcasters and their audiences"<br/>
			(p.286). We can clearly see how these two authors argue that<br/>
			through the intersection and interactions of these technologies,<br/>
			they determine and define what race means online as well as<br/>
			offline in the real world. The image that I created represents<br/>
			YouTube, and the fact that we are able to see ourselves through<br/>
			this "video" shows the different identities that are seen on this<br/>
			SNS. YouTube is an example that shows us how we are globally<br/>
			connected by race instead of being divided by it. The words that<br/>
			are following the cursor in this image represent the possible<br/>
			thoughts or reactions that could be going through a person's<br/>
			mind. It lets us discover our identity and broadcast our racial<br/>
			self.</p>

		<p class="entry-title">Prompt #4: Cartography of the Spectacle</p>
		<p class="date">Posted: April 20th, 2015</p>
		<img class="displayed" src="images/asg4.png" width="691" height="391"/><br/><br/><br/>
		<p>	When you look at the image, what do you think about it? One thing about<br/>
			the picture is that it's dark, its in front of some door and the person<br/>
			in the picture is fully clothed and it is impossible to see any exposed<br/>
			skin. You also see the person holding a bag of some kind. Based off of<br/>
			these observations, you can come up with many assumptions. One such<br/>
			assumption is that the person in the picture is about to rob a home.<br/>
			However, what thoughts come to mind when you make that assumption. One<br/>
			of which is race. One might assume the person is a certain race due to<br/>
			the person's actions and what races most commonly do that action. One<br/>
			race that someone might assume is that the person is black, despite not<br/>
			knowing anything about the person that could actually provide a<br/>
			reasonable explanation of the race. However, one thing wrong about this<br/>
			is that people shouldn't associate one action with a certain race, but<br/>
			instead should associate the action with the person's class and that<br/>
			there may be a reason why the person is doing what they're doing. "The<br/>
			Watts riot was not a racial conflict: the rioters left alone the whites<br/>
			that were in their path, attacking only the white policemen, while on<br/>
			the other hand black solidarity did not extend to black store-owners or<br/>
			even to black car-drivers. Martin Luther King himself had to admit that<br/>
			the revolt went beyond the limits of his specialty. Speaking in Paris<br/>
			last October, he said: 'This was not a race riot. It was a class<br/>
			riot.'" (Guy 1). This article says that even famous riots and events<br/>
			were not all about race and were actually about their rights and<br/>
			cruelty of the law. That is what my image portrays.</p>
			
		<!--PROMPT 5-->
		<p class="entry-title">Prompt #5: The Augmented Human- Free Play!</p>
		<p class="date">Posted: April 30th, 2015</p>
                <div id="processingDiv">

		<p>	At first glance at this interactive image, assuming you started from the<br/>
		left, you see a small circle that's green and new and moving a little to <br/>
		the left and right, you see that it grows the further right you go. As <br/>
		you keep going, it slowly starts to change color a little bit, also the<br/>
		color is becoming more explosive and random. You also see a yellow <br/>
		pillar in the middle with 2 entrances on both sides, seeing that on the <br/>
		other side it has the word "end". The closer you get to the yellow <br/>
		pillar, the crazier and bigger the circle gets. Once you go inside the <br/>
		mysterious pillar, the circle is gone and it is one step closer to <br/>reaching the other side. However, once you go further in, you see the<br/>
		"start" sign in the beginning start to fade, the once glorified "end" <br/>
		sign becomes a more blood red, and coming out of the yellow pillar is a<br/>
		white square. Once you reach the end of the line, more white squares <br/>
		join you and that is the end. Although these are just simple shapes, <br/>
		they do represent an important inssue in today's world. Students in the<br/>
		present day have a false view of the ideal lifestyle, with "flexibility<br/>
		being more important than knowledge, they are valued for their ability<br/>
		to discard acquired skills and learn new ones" (Mason 68). In my image<br/>
		the circle in the beginning represents the youth, growing until they <br/>
		reach the yellow pillar which is school and anything else that <br/>
		influences their ideals. The circle is full of potential which the <br/>
		flashing colors represent, and once it crosses the other side, it<br/>
		becomes a blank square and joins the rest of the blank square.</p>
